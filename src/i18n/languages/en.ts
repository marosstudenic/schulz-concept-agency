I appreciate that the designer printed objects and tools directly from the winery and then reflected them in the entire visual identity. We plan more projects together in the future. Schulz Concept also manages our social networks and websites. They are able to take care of everything a company needs.",

    "Truly a top-level partner. I've been more than satisfied with our collaboration from the beginning. Meeting Mr. Schulz was friendly, and he asked sophisticated questions. I feel like he knows my company and vision more than I do. He is always open about what is happening and finds a solution for every problem. I had a problem creating a brand from our company. We had quality products but couldn't promote ourselves enough and differentiate from the competition. After rebranding and a new marketing strategy, our sales increased by 140% in the first 3 months and continue to grow. The designer was very kind and precisely captured our values in creating the logo and visual identity. I highly recommend and look forward to what else our collaboration will bring!",
